# CS-E4770 Project 1: bit.ly-like Applications

This is the first project of CS-E4770 Designing and Building Scalable Web Applications at Aalto University. The goal is to compare the performance of various bit.ly-like implementations, namely, [vanilla Deno](https://deno.land/), [oak](https://github.com/oakserver/oak), and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).

Check [the report](REPORT.md) to see the usage and performance metrics.
